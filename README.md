# YSword5 - My profile
Hey! I'm YSword5, a developer aiming to create **awesome** things for the public! Look at my (active) repos (if there are any) and check them out!

## My projects
I've created some really cool things! Take a look!

### YSpeed Browser
A browser, literally, a browser. Except it doesn't use Chromium, or Gecko, instead my 'renderer.html' displays what should be shown as "the browser". It uses iframes with a fully working URL bar!


### YSpeed Browser App
I couldn't believe I did this. But it's pretty simple (if AI helped you set it up). When using **node.js**, you can use something called '[Expo](https://expo.dev)'
