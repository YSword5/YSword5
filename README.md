# YSpeed - Our Profile
Hey everyone! We're __YSpeed__, a software company creating one thing: A __browser__.

## YSpeed Features:
YSpeed uses __Chromium__, so browsers like **Google Chrome**, **Microsoft Edge**, and **Brave** share the same powerful foundation.  
This means YSpeed is built for speed, security, and compatibility with the modern web.

### What makes YSpeed different?
- **Performance-first design**: Optimized with Rust and C++ for maximum efficiency.  
- **Privacy focus**: Enhanced tracking protection and secure defaults.  
- **Custom innovation**: Unique features tailored to user experience, beyond what mainstream browsers offer.  
- **Cross-platform support**: Runs smoothly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Our Mission
We believe browsing should be **fast, safe, and empowering**. YSpeed is not just another browser—it’s a new way to experience the web.
